# Contributing

Hi there! I'm thrilled that you'd like to contribute to `github-api.feedback`!

First things first: By participating in this project you agree to abide by the terms of our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

The most valuable contribution is a review of the existing wishlist, and submitting additions of use cases. The more use cases exist, and the more diverse they are, the better the wish will work as a base of discussion for the respective GitHub teams who decide and implement new APIs.

You are welcome to submit new wishes, and I do appreciate your contribution and am looking forward to discuss them, but I cannot make guarantuees of accepting them.
