## About me

My name is Gregor Martynus, I'm the maintainer of [GitHub's official SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/octokit/rest.js). As part of my work I encounter recurring proplems with today's GitHub APIs. This repository is a curated list of APIs that I would like to see, together with use cases to showcase why they are needed. I invite you all to submit your own wishes, or amend the existing ones.
